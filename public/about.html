<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi I'm Steven <br>
  and I'm a Web Developer 
</p>

<p>
  Right now I'm working at Landeshauptstadt München (for the City of Munich). <br>
  I studied Wirtschaftsinformatik at FOM (Hochschule für Ökonomie und Management). I wrote my Bachelor from February 2023 to May 2023. <br>
  Now I want to make a small brake and for that I'm just going to work and don't think about University. <br>
  After maybe one year of working I wanna go back to University and there I will accomplish my Master.
